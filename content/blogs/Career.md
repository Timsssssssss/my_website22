# My journey with data

In 2019, I had summer school at UC Berkeley and took a course called Intro to Principles of Data Science, where i learnt about how to manipulate and analyze data through Pandas and implement basic regression analysis in Python. Walking through numerous interesting hands-on projects such as sentiment analysis of Trump's Twitter and a spam filter, I was fascinated by the power of data and would like to know the principles behind those models. 

Therefore, I chose Statistics as my major during my undergraduate study. In the following 3 years, I acquired different statistical modeling skills such as time series, machine learning and stochastic process. I love to solve problems using data and always seeking opportunity to apply what I learn to real life. The initial motivation for me to pursue a career in analytics came from a favor I did when I was a sophomore. My father's friend, who worked in the Shanghai Fire Department, asked me to provide some ideas about the digital transformation project. I performed some analysis on historical conflagration data and built a random forest model to classify those cases into three levels. It was the first time that I had applied what I learnt in class to solve real-life problems and I enjoyed it. Hence, I started to think of being an analyst.

So far, I have got hands on experience in using machine learning to predict future products' offtake at Danone, seeing how data is integrated into business context. At GrowthBox, I acquired valuable business knowledge about driving growth. Now, studying at LBS as a MAM student helps me dig deeper in the field of analytics, gainning more insights about how data facilitates business.
