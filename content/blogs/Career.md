## Beginning with data

In 2019, I had summer school at UC Berkeley and took a course called Intro to Principles of Data Science, where i learnt about how to manipulate and analyze data through Pandas and implement basic regression analysis in Python. Walking through numerous interesting hands-on projects such as sentiment analysis of Trump's Twitter and a spam filter, I was fascinated by the power of data and would like to know the principles behind those models. 

Therefore, I chose Statistics as my major during my undergraduate study. In the following 3 years, I acquired different statistical modeling skills such as time series, machine learning and stochastic process. I love to solve problems using data and always seeking opportunity to apply what I learn to real life. The initial motivation for me to pursue a career in analytics came from a favor I did when I was a sophomore. My father's friend, who worked in the Shanghai Fire Department, asked me to provide some ideas about the digital transformation project. I performed some analysis on historical conflagration data and built a random forest model to classify those cases into three levels. It was the first time that I had applied what I learnt in class to solve real-life problems and started thinking of applying analytic skills in work.

## Integrate Into Business

At Danone as an advanced-analytics intern, I got the chance to solve business problems with data. The team was developing a machine learning model to predict future offtakes. It was not only a technical problem, but also a business problem. Despite of tuning parameters and designing algorithms, we also tried to improve the model from the business prospective. We identified and verified factors which affected sales and put them in the model. Through this experience, I not only learnt how to integrate data with business, but more importantly, immersed in the business context and gained business acumen. 

At the beginning of 2022, I joined GrothBox, a start-up company which focused on studying and solving business growth related problems. This work helped me dig deeper in business. My first research project started with the [digital transformation of L'Oreal](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/DQMCA4JE3KQpGp68E7I77Q)
