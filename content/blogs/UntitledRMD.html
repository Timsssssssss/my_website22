<div id="football" class="section level1">
<h1>Football</h1>
<p>Football is a part of my life, I started to watch football since I was 8 and started to play from middle school. I also dedicated myself to contributing to the community as the president of football club both in High School and University.</p>
<div id="as-a-player" class="section level2">
<h2>As a player</h2>
<p>I was the player of the school team both in high school and university. It’s a great experience that I can meet a group of people within my age who share the same passion with me. We trained hard together and played football every week. Although we were not the strongest team and did not always win tournaments, we had a great time together. Through playing football, I learnt how to be a team player through teamwork, being supportive and diligency.</p>

<div id="as-one-of-the-lovers" class="section level2">
<h2>As one of the lovers</h2>
<p>I joined the Sports Department under Student Association in high school and became the president in my senior year. I was responsible for writing proposal and organizing sports matches such as football, basketball and table tennis within the grade.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../../../../ab/hf.jpg" width="1000px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This was my first experience as an activity organizer, learning from the beginning is hard, but I gained experience and improved my communication and planning ability by going through these.</p>
<p>Entering college, football club provided me an opportunity to focus on football. Freshmen Cup; College Cup; Match Viewing Events, all those events gathered football lovers together and formed a community within the school. The club number grew from 85 to 240 during my tenure.</p>

<p>We are also pioneers. We organized several training for girls to encourage them joining this game, since there are not too many girls playing football. We also worked with the university sports department and founded the university men’s soccer team, hiring the coach and scheduled the training.</p>

<div id="diversity" class="section level1">
<h1>Diversity</h1>
<p>Back in high school, I attended the World School Sport Educational Game held in Greece, where I met students from other countries such as England, Italy, and Brazil. We lived together for two weeks and soon became friends through games and discussions. It was the first time that I had lived in an international community.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../../../../ab/gk.jpg" width="1000px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In college, I met students from different cities and even different countries, which provided me a great chance to get along with different types of people. During my sophomore year, I volunteered to be a buddy of one of the exchange students, who came from Denmark. I helped him solve problems and get used to life in China. I also brought him and other international students to the stadium to watch football games. We spent a great semester together and now we are still in touch. Through those experiences, I realized people are very different in a lot of aspects from country to country. However, it is important that we can respect each other’s culture and be willing to communicate.</p>

<p>I am pleased to embrace different cultures and make friends with people from all over the world. Now at LBS, I am study in a diversified cohort and in a study group where people are from different countries, working in a diversified group at a more professional and rigorous level.</p>
